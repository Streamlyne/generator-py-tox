# generator-py-tox [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dreid93/generator-py-tox.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dreid93/generator-py-tox)

This generator is used to create a tox.ini file for (Tox)[http://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#] testing Python projects. At it's current state it fully emulates the functionality of the CLT ``tox-quickstart``. 

### Why Yeoman?

Yeoman is awesome! ``tox-quickstart`` is capable of generating a basic tox.ini file, though is not expandable. As a developer, I would like to be able to easily generate potentially more complex tox.ini files. Using yeoman, and developing a yeoman generator, makes it simple to expand the functionality of my tox.ini generator. :D

### Install

```
$ npm install -g generator-py-tox
```

### Run
